## Overview

This is the output of the first assignment. The objective is to initiate a git repository, create an R script to display numbers 1 through 10 and create an r markdown file explaining the process

This is the first step in the r script to create a vector variable with the numbers 1 through 10

```{r}
a <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
```

The next step is to print the vector

```{r}
print(a)
```
